# Hands on NLP with Transformers

This repository contains code for the [O'Reilly Live Online Training for Hands on NLP with Transformers](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/hands-on-nlp-with-transformers/0636920063159/0636920063158/)

This training will provide an introduction to the novel transformer architecture which is currently considered state of the art for modern NLP tasks. We will take a deep dive into what makes the transformer unique in its ability to process natural language including attention and encoder-decoder architectures. We will see several examples of how people and companies are using transformers to solve a wide variety of NLP tasks including conversation-holding, image captioning, reading comprehension, and more.

This training will feature several code-driven examples of transformer-derived architectures including BERT, GPT, T5, and the Vision Transformer. Each of our case studies will be inspired by real use-cases and will lean on transfer learning to expedite our process while using actionable metrics to drive results.
