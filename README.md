# Transformer Architectures for Generative AI

This repository contains code for the [O'Reilly Live Online Training for "Transformer Architectures for Generative AI"](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/transformer-architectures-for-generative-ai/0642572010589)

This course is designed to provide a deep understanding of transformer architectures and their revolutionary impact on both natural language processing (NLP) and vision tasks. This course is crucial for professionals looking to stay at the forefront of AI advancements, as transformers are now the cornerstone of many state-of-the-art models. By combining theory with practical exercises, participants will learn how to harness the power of transformers to tackle complex problems in text, image, and multimodal AI.
